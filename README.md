# Teach Yourself Algorithms in JavaScript (and TypeScript)

## ðŸ‘‹ Hi friends!

A few years ago I wanted to relearn [data structures and algorithms](https://www.adamconrad.dev/tag/algorithms/). It was fun to read _The Algorithm Design Manual_ but like many have said before, this stuff doesn't stick.

So I decided to write these out myself. But even if you write out the underlying structures you still need to practice.

This is the home of my data structures, algorithms, and their applications from my practice on [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/acconrad). If you want to learn more about what powers how we build software, take a look at the code samples above!
